## 🚀 Projects (What I’m Actively Building)

### 🔗 URL Shortener App — *First Public Release*
A focused, production-minded URL shortener built as a smaller project to ship fast, iterate quickly, and scale cleanly.

- 🔹 API + SPA architecture  
- 🔹 AWS-backed (serverless-friendly)  
- 🔹 Designed with abuse-prevention and scalability in mind  
- 🔹 **This will be my first released project**

**Repositories**
- **Backend:** https://github.com/thecompstudguy/url-shortener-be  
- **Frontend:** https://github.com/thecompstudguy/url-shortener-fe

### ☕ UniversiTEA — *Ongoing / Larger Project*
A larger, longer-term platform centered around conversations, communities, and controlled chaos—built primarily around Telegram.

While the URL Shortener ships first due to its smaller scope, **UniversiTEA is still actively being developed**.

- 🔹 Telegram-based platform  
- 🔹 Focus on anonymity, social dynamics, and “tea” culture  
- 🔹 Built to evolve in phases

## 💻 About Me
- 🧠 I build things when inspiration strikes… or when caffeine convinces me.
- 🛠 Mostly backend-brained, but comfortable shipping full stacks.
- 🧋 Runs on milk tea, code, and questionable architectural decisions.
- 🔍 Frequently overthinking simple problems and underthinking complex ones.
- 🚀 Currently focused on **shipping**, not just tinkering.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stuff I Touch
- **Languages:** JavaScript / TypeScript, PHP, Python  
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Vite, React, Node.js, Serverless Framework  
- **Platforms:** AWS, Telegram Mini Apps, GitHub  
- **Databases:** DynamoDB, MySQL

## 🎯 Current Goals
- Ship real projects, not just ideas  
- Build small → learn fast → scale intentionally  
- Balance gym reps with GitHub commits  
- Create tools and platforms that spark conversation (or mild confusion)
