### 💻 About Me
- 🧠 I build things when inspiration strikes… or when caffeine convinces me.
- 💪 Strong opinions, stronger biceps.
- 🧋 Runs on milk tea, code, and questionable decision-making.
- 🛠 Always tinkering with side projects that may or may not ever see daylight.
- 🔍 Frequently found overthinking simple problems and underthinking complex ones.

---

### 🔧 Tech Stuff I Touch
- **Languages:** JavaScript / TypeScript, PHP, Python (on good days)  
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Vite, React, Node.js, Serverless Framework  
- **Platforms:** AWS, Telegram Mini Apps, GitHub  
- **Databases:** DynamoDB, MySQL, and whatever else accepts my late-night queries  

---

### 🚧 Things I'm Working On
- A platform for conversations, communities, and a bit of chaos  
- Experiments involving anonymity, creativity, and “tea” ☕  
- Tools that help me learn, iterate, and ship weird ideas  
- Projects that start as jokes and somehow become real  

---

### 🎯 Goals (for Now)
- Turn curiosity into code  
- Ship more, overthink less  
- Balance gym reps with GitHub commits  
- Build things that spark conversations or confusion
